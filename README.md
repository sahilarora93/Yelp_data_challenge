# Yelp Data Challenge Project

**GROUP NAME:** Python Wranglers  
**SECTION:** 2  
**MEMBER NAME:** Sahil Arora, Sanjana Rosario, Riddhi Kanoi, Huy Nguyen

### 1. What we did in this project

* **Problem Statement**: Restaurant review platforms have become our default way of searching for restaurants for every occasion. There exist straightforward means of filtering for prices, locations and cuisine (restaurant filters) and even broad categories of restaurants that you could sift through. However, when looking for specific attributes of a restaurant, or less generic contexts, this search isn’t as straightforward.

* **Look into the users' reviews and tips and apply topic modelling to gain insights into customers' perception of a restaurant**: Most reviews start with the context of the occasion, company present and contain specifics on the ambience of the place. A user has to go through numerous reviews for every restaurant considered to see if the restaurant would be a perfect match for the occasion. This is too time-consuming a process. Our team is looking to provide a solution to this problem by enabling users to search for restaurants based on more distinct categories. Specifically, we will apply Topic Modelling Techniques to the restaurant’s existing reviews to help users select the best dining options according to their moods and purposes.    

* **Creating a Winning Formula for Restaurant Success**: By analyzing data and predict restaurants' successes based on Machine Learning model, we help business owners understand the success factors and how their restaurant will give customers the best experience possible. We plan to identify the key drivers of success and failures of restaurants and predict whether a restaurant will succeed or not compared to its peers based on those drivers.

### 2. Usage:

- At this is largely a data analysis project, you will need to download the data in "Dataset" below, convert the JSON file to CSV using the tool below, and run notebooks (4 parts) as described in Section 3. 
- [Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset): The dataset is provided by Yelp and can be downloaded from their website. The dataset's [documentation](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/main) is also available.
- You will need to use [JSON to CSV converter](https://github.com/sahilarora93/Yelp_data_challenge/blob/master/json_to_csv_converter.py) to convert the provided JSON file. 
- You will need to install all packages outlined in [Requirements](https://github.com/sahilarora93/Yelp_data_challenge/blob/master/requirements.txt)
- All codes assume the installation of Python 3.6+
